    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning tool that will help predicting the severity of an accident based on some key features (such as weather, driving conditions, road conditions etc). This problem is particularly important for the city of Seattle: the city has been moving towards achieving 0 traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030 and has launched [Vision Zero](https://www.seattle.gov/visionzero) but as explained in [this Seattle Transit Blog entry from 2018](https://seattletransitblog.com/2018/01/05/traffic-volumes-collision-rate/), collisions with fatal or serious injury jumped *16.5%* in 2016, even as traffic volumes remained nearly unchanged. It is hence of paramount importance to develop techniques that can help understand, predict and even avoid accidents based on their severity and that's what this project is about."
